# The-Perfect-Guess-Project


In this game you have to guess a number between 1 to 99.If you guess wrong then the computer will interact with you & give  you some hints until you guess the correct number & I've made this game such a way that it will count your guesses as a score.
If you have win with less guesses then it will your highscore & if you break the record of highscore of previous player then it will automatically print the score in Highscore.txt file.



This project is an interactive guessing game, which will ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 99. We are using the random module with the randint function to get a random number. The project code also contains a while loop, which make the code run until the user guess the right number.
